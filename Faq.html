            the GrowthSchool Experience. Hence we won‚Äôt be providing recordings

            We built this GrowthSchool Experience to make it accessible to
            hundreds and thousands of people at scale.To make that happen we had
            to solve this one big problem:
            <strong>Mentor‚Äôs availability and time.<br /><br />‚Äç</strong>Your
            mentors quite literally are in the top 1% of their industry which
            means their time is expensive as well as inadequate. The cost of
            running the programs instantly goes up if they keep teaching the
            same thing again and again.<br /><br />That‚Äôs exactly why the
            GrowthSchool Experience is a perfect blend of both worlds. You get
            to learn from your favourite mentor with like-minded people in a
            stream at a lost of less than a pizza :)<br />

            stream with like-minded doers like you, while participating in
            polls, answering thought-provoking questions, attempting quizzes,
            and doing many more exciting activities.By the end of the

            The content is owned by GrowthSchool. It is not allowed to record

            repercussions.<br />But here‚Äôs what you should do üòõ<br />Our best
            learners usually take notes or create mind maps and share them with
            the community. So, if you want to revisit your learnings or see what
            was in the content of the session, just take notes and revisit them
            in the future.<br />Not only does it increase learning output also
            makes the overall learning experience much much better. Don‚Äôt

            Ask yourselves this simple question: How many online courses have
            you taken up to date? Out of them, how many did you actually
            complete?<br /><br />Based on all our learnings and surveys in our
            community, the completion rate lies between 2-3%<br /><br />Over
            multiple experiments and ideation, we figured out that giving people
            access to content is not enough. Making people consume and finish
            the session is the most important thing.It is of no use if you just
            register for sessions and never watch them. But with our tech, we
            are providing a rich interaction-led experience with polls, quizzes,
            and chats which have helped us increase completion rates of learners
            go from 2-3% to hit 90%<br /><br />We believe in our community of
